# _WEATHER OR NOT_

Exploring _National State Parks_...when the weather permits.

<h2>-Objective-

**_*Weather or Not*_** was created to provide users with an easy tool to discover and locate local state parks, and plan the perfect time to go with weather forecast.

    MVP: Build a responsive and interactive website implementing two server-side API's to list State Parks and display map.

<h2> -Usage-

When users arrive on **_*Weather or Not*_** website, they will use the dropdown menu to scroll and select their state. The user will then see a list of state parks and make a selection to show additional information, all while receiving map and weather updates.
